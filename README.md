# Hades Boon Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I left the above text in here because I figure, might as well make sure no one thinks I actually built an entire moderately functional app environment all on my own.

If you're reading this, you probably want to [go to the main site (not actually active yet)](https://geekkid1.github.io/hades-boon-calc), but if you're here to modify the app for yourself, then welcome! You're in the right place, right branch, right everything, assuming I set things up correctly which I *think* I did.

## React-app setup

Obviously, the vast bulk of the project code, like dependencies and build files and such, are not here. In a clever bit of setup, `create-react-app` created a `.gitignore` that would very nicely keep me from sending the entirety of my very bulky `node-packages` folder to GitHub. Here's the cool bit though, it made it easier for other users to install all those packages.

So, clone or fork-then-clone this repository to a workspace that works well for you, then make sure you have either npm or yarn, preferably yarn since that is what I used. From there, you can use the included files to install all the dependencies quickly, or so I have been led to believe. Assuming it works, enjoy your freshly setup development environment.
